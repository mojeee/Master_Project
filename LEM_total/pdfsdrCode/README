The PDF-building code is much easier than the LEM code.

Some comments to consider:
1) The binning is taken from Jin's 2008 paper; there are 51 bins
   -- if this is not desired, can just interpolate later using Matlab
2)       PARAMETER(N = 2122, NBIN = 51, NSIM = 3500,
     1    DELTA_CUTOFF = 100, BIG = 400000, SPACE = 2,
     2    NTHREADS = 24)
   -- N = number of cells in the realisations, need to change to your case
   -- NBIN = 51 here
   -- NSIM = number of realisations
   -- DELTA_CUTOFF, BIG and SPACE may need to be changed, but typically they are fine
      -> they have to do with the boundary truncations, mainly a memory problem
   -- NTHREADS = number of processors to use in parallel
3) the input data file must be named interpedc.csv
4) Can take a look at NORMDATA to see exactly how you want to normalise the data
   -- different calculation for temperature, CO2, etc.
   --> maybe you want to use the CO2_EQ value to normalise the data, or 
       max CO2 value in this realisation. It's your choice and can be changed in 
       this subroutine


to compile:
just type make
and the program is called:
go




The SDR-building code:

ifort -O3 gradc.f (or no O3, just an optimiser)

it will take the LEM data (interpc.csv) and calculate the gradients.
The output is the average gradient of the progress variable.
--> which means the Diffusion coefficient will need to be multiplied into the 
    output file after the fact since:
    the conditional SDR = (diffusion coefficient)*(grad c)*(grad c)

Things to consider:
1) The binning is now 50 evenly spaced bins
2)     PARAMETER(N = 2122, NBIN = 50, NSIM = 3500)
   -- N	  = number of cells in the realisations, need to change to your case
   -- NBIN = 50 here
   -- NSIM = number of realisations
3) the input data file must be named interpedc.csv
4) Can take a look at NORMDATA to see exactly how you want to normalise the data
   -- different calculation for temperature, CO2, etc.
   --> maybe you want to use the CO2_EQ value to normalise the data, or 
       max CO2 value in	 this realisation. It's your choice and can be changed in 
       this subroutine


Once you have the conditional SDR, an inner product with the PDF table 
is required to get the unconditional SDR. The unconditional SDR is the number 
that would need to be tabulated at each mean and variance combination!

I may have several Matlab scripts for post-processing the PDF/SDR into OpenFOAM 
formats.
