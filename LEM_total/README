This package will allow one to create the LEM PDF from scratch.
There are three steps:

1) Run the LEM simulations to collect enough temperature or CO2 realisations 
   -- will need to edit code depending on which, right now it's set to CO2
   -- this is the hardest part of the process, may need some time to learn it...
   -- everything is located in the lemCode directory
   -- further README file located in the lemCode directory to explain everything

2) Build LEM PDF / "SDR" using those realisations
   -- this is easy, just run the fortran scripts
   -- the PDF is built from bmp10.f
   -- the "SDR" is built from gradc.f
      --> note, only the conditional gradients are provided by gradc.f,
          not the SDR!
      --> will need to use the conditional gradients to build the SDR at step 3
      --> The reason is that the PDF and conditional gradients are general 
          to all progress variables, whereas the SDR needs the diffusion 
          coefficient or thermal diffusivity, so I decided to split it.
   -- further README file located in the pdfsdrCode directory to explain everything


3) Convert the LEM PDF to Graham's CSEFoam format
   -- this is also easy, just give the script the appropriate files
   -- further information located in the header of the script to explain everything

And hopefully that's that!
